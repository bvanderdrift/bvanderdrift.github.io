#Vergiel

So, it seemed that a lot of people mistype "Virgiel" which is a [fraternatiy in Delft, The Netherlands](http://virgiel.nl). The site is hosted on http://vergiel.nl.

This project has been set up as a joke to the people who do this mistype. They will be shown some awesome stuff after which they will be redirected to the actual site.

The first version has been developed as a plain HTML site, which was hosted through GitHub pages. The second edition has been redeveloped with Meteor so that the amount of users who mistype can be tracked better
